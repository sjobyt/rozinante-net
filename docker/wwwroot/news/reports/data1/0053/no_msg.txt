So when storms come sailing across your deep blue ocean.
Hold fast to your dreaming for all that you're worth.
For as long as there's been dreamers, there will always be sailors.
Bringing back tehir bright treasures from the corners of the world.

But to every sailor comes time to drop anchor.
Haul in the sails, and make lines fast
You deep water dreamer, your journey is over.
You're finaly safe in harbour at last.
You¨re safe in harbour now.
- "Safe in harbour", Eric Bogle

Natt i Hobart nå, har vært her en ca. 8 timer nå.

Hvordan det gikk seg til er en altfor lang historie.....
