1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,990
Around the world with Staale and Rozinante ended dramatically.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,990
But exciting events happened earlier.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He was alone day and night, two months alone on Rozinante.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,990
But one week after he left Australia he visited an island...

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,990
So we found Auckland Island.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,990
It's here the Albatrosses live. It's here they get born!

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And then they fly out on the ocean.

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,990
This place is a very safe place to anchor.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The island was full of strange animals, not people.
It was quite funny.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,990
I spent about a week on the island and celebrated new years eve.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Along with the albatrosses and a group of not-hospitable seals.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,990
The sun is very strong here. Because we are so close to Antarctica.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,990
Now we're going in and look at this beach.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
As soon as Staale placed his foot on the island, the welcome-comitee
arrived.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,990
This meeting didn't actually turn out te be the touching encounter -

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
- between the inhabitant and the sailor as Staale hoped.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,990
Soon it was very clear who was the owner of this beach.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think he's decided to kill me.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,990
The intruder has to find an alternate passage into the island.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,990
The reason why I'm looking like a combination of a stoneage man-

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,990
-and a modern soldier, is because we have declared war on the
combat-seal.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,990
And he's not very small.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's why we had to walk through the jungle.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,990
He attacked when we tried to go through the beach.

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,990
And I don't know how such animal thinks.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In fact I've never been more scared in my life when he attacked
the dingy!

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,990
But now I'm armed.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,990
The expedition finds a cabin.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We have found a cabin with food for shipwrecked.

30
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think it's time to replace some of it!

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It doesn't seem to be updated very often.

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,990
"Left by members of seafarer April 1977".

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
"Visited by Finesse of Tasman. From Hobart, Tasmania
February 1988".

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
"Pirate Ship Rozinante, Norway. 01/01-2006. Staale."

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Bye, bye Auckland Island. Now we're off!

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You'll be in our back for 40 days, before we get to Cape Horn.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You'll just stay here and be a strict nature's reserve.

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now we've visited you without getting a penalty. And it's a bit
amusing!

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now we're going to cross the date-line. This is the first time.

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The time is 02:31, 8th of January.

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Outside it's strong gale.

42
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oops! I didn't noticed we crossed.

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now it's says west instead of east.
